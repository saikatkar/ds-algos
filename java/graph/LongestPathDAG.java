/**
 * Given a Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a source vertex s in it, find the longest distances from s to all other vertices in the given graph.
The longest path problem for a general graph is not as easy as the shortest path problem because the longest path problem doesnâ€™t have optimal substructure property.
 In fact, the Longest Path problem is NP-Hard for a general graph. However, the longest path problem has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs. 
 The idea is similar to linear time solution for shortest path in a directed acyclic graph., we use Topological Sorting.
