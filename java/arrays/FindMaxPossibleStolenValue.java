/**
 * There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbour left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value.

	Examples:
	
	Input  : hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
	Output : 19
	Thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from house.
	
	Input  : hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
	Output : 16
	Thief will steal 5 and 11
